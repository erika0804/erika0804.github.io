# My personal website

## This website houses my resume and portfolio. My portfolio includes GIS, cartography, and other related products I've developed in my academic and professional experiences, as well as products created for fun

### I was heavily inspired by the Jekyll Minimal theme from GitHub Pages: https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal
